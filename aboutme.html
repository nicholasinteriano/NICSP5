  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Nicholas Interiano, I love to program and I love to read and learn astrophysics. Some personal things I do are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Play Basketball</li>
  <li>Read about Astrology and learn Astrophysics</li>
  <li>Program</li>
  <li>Play Video Games</li>
  <p> Let's go in-depth. I play Point Guard for basketball whenever I play. I hardly play Small Forward but sometimes I am put in that position. I'm a great passer, and I can shoot the ball.</p>
  <p> For Astrology and Astrophysics, I learn from many places! Some ways I learn about Astrophysics are from: Books, Websites, People (most notable person named Neil DeGrasse Tyson) And many more! This I leave to perhaps boggle your mind? But, this is one of many quotes I find intriguing, "I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier. Not as something to be conquered but to be explored." - Neil DeGrasse Tyson</p>
</ul>
